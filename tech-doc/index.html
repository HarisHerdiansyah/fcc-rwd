            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

            To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and
            write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              function greet(name) {
                alert("Hello " + name);
              }
              
              greet("Haris");
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
            browser!

          <p>
            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <article>
          <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
          <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              var x = 42;
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              x = 42.
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
            JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
          </p>
          <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              let x = 42.
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
          </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Scope">
        <header>Scope</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (true) { var x = 5; } 
              console.log(x); // 5
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              if (true) { let y = 5; } 
              console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
            </code>
          </pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Six data types that are primitives:
              <ul class="child-list">
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
            you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
            functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You
            can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions
            as procedures that your application can perform.
